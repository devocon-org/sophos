An IP address is a numerical label assigned to the devices connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication. IP address act as an identifier for a specific machine on a particular network. It also helps you to develop a virtual connection between a destination and a source.

_**Types of Website IP Addresses**_

* Share IP Address
* Dedicated IP Address

_**Shared IP Addresses**_

Shared IP address is used by small business websites that do not yet get many visitors or have many files or pages on their site. The IP address is not unique and it is shared with other websites.

_**Dedicated IP Addresses**_

Dedicated IP address is assigned uniquely to each website. Dedicated IP addresses helps you avoid any potential backlists because of bad behavior from others on your server. The dedicated IP address also gives you the option of pulling up your website using the IP address alone, instead of your domain name. It also helps you to access your website when you are waiting on a domain transfer.

_**Version of IP address**_

 * IPV4
 * IPV6.

**IPV4**

IPv4 was the first version of IP. It was deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. Today it is the most widely used IP version. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.

The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses, which is more than 4 billion addresses. To date, it is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.

**IPV6**

It is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. Internet Engineer Taskforce initiated it in early 1994. The design and development of that suite is now called IPv6.

This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address space.
